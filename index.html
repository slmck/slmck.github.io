<p> The Exploration of Egalitarianism Digital Education Kit explores the UNESCO Stone Age site of Çatalhöyük and its egalitarian society. Through the use of 3D printed replicas of real artifacts, a virtual tour of reconstructed houses, a ChatBot, and an interactive activity, students learn what egalitarianism is, how it is reflected in the archaeology, and what it might have meant to live in an egalitarian community! This Kit is designed for use of Key Stage 3 students (ages 11-14), however it has successfully been used with young people between the ages of 8-16.
