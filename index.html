<p> The Çatalhöyük School Kit explores the UNESCO Stone Age site of Çatalhöyük and its egalitarian society. Through the use of 3D printed replicas of real artifacts, a virtual tour of reconstructed houses, a ChatBot, and an interactive activity, students learn what egalitarianism is, how it is reflected in the archaeology, and what it might have meant to live in an egalitarian community! 
 
 <br> 
 <br>
 
 The school kit has 3 components:
  <ul> 
    <li> <a href="/Stage1.html"> Welcome to Çatalhöyük: </a> A personality quiz to determine your role in Çatalhöyük. </li>
    <li> <a href="/Stage2.html"> An Egalitarian Trading Experience:</a> An interactive exploration of reconstructed houses from Çatalhöyük, in which participants make some tough decisions about their possessions!</li>
    <li> <a href="/Stage3.html"> Bo the Chatbot:</a> A group discussion led by a Chatbot that reveals more about the site and prompts participants to think about what it means to live in an egalitarian society. </li>
</ul>
