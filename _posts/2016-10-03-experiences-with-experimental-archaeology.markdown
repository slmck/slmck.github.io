How can archaeologists get into the minds of the people they study? When presented with a dirt pit and broken pottery it can be difficult to construct any ideas about the daily lives of the people who lived there. Experimental archaeology is one of many approaches to understanding past cultures. The main feature of experimental archaeology is the hands-on approach to replicating and testing different methods of manufacture, use and wear of archaeological objects and artifacts. Its important to note that experimental archaeology is not necessarily direct reconstructions but rather attempts to reconstruct based on the best archaeological evidence.

Experimental archaeology is a fantastic method of learning about the creation and use of objects. For one of my university classes, I was challenged to develop an experimental archaeology project with a partner. Grace Wicken, and I decided to create Paleolithic stone lamps.  From this experience I learned about the lamps but additionally about the act of doing experimental archaeology.  
<br>
<br>
	Before we could begin hitting rocks together we had to do research. Paleolithic stone lamps, dating to 40,000 years old, have been found In Northern Spain and France. Interestingly, the lamps are primarily found in locations with access to sunlight, such as open air or rock shelter sites, rather than dark, deep caves as we might have expected. Most importantly however our research determined what type of lamp we needed to make. This was a limestone lamp with a lichen wick and cow fat as fuel.

	The second stage of completing our archaeological experiment was to obtain the materials. This proved a slight challenge and I can only imagine that this would be quite an endeavor in larger scale projects. For our project it required phoning multiple quarries and driving to the small town of Duncan, BC, at six in the morning before class to collect limestone rocks. Thankfully we had a few things on our side; a kind company who gave us the stones for free and a lot of Tim Horton’s donuts.  For the rest of the materials we enlisted my family. My grandparents picked up some local lichen on a hike and my mother saved the fat from a few family roasts.  Family has always been and remains a student’s best resource. Thanks Mom! Again this stage would differ drastically depending on what your project required and how large a project it was.

	After we acquired all necessary materials and ate all of the delicious dinners to do so, we began to actually attempt the creation of stone lamps.  We quickly realized that our neighbours were not overly fond of the sounds that came from multiple people smashing stones together. Thus we ended up building the lamps in the basement storage room at my parents’ apartment. Thanks again Mom! It was at this time that we had to develop some more skills. To produce the stone lamps we had to use a technique called pecking. Essentially this is hitting one weaker rock with another slightly stronger rock in the same location to make an indent. This may seem very simple but alas it is not. In our attempts to peck we would often hit the wrong spot, break off an oversize chunk and damage the bowl, or perhaps more unfortunately hit ourselves. This was the first and only class project to leave me not only with knowledge but also bruises. In addition the act of pecking was loud, messy and fairly time consuming. Each lamp took us two and a half hours. In total we created three separate lamps.

	After finally producing the lamps, our next step was to use them. Unfortunately no matter how hard we tried we were unable to make the lichen work as a wick. Thankfully we were prepared for this and had purchased, not-so-genuine or Paleolithic approved wicks from the craft store Michaels. During this process we learned the importance of the shape of the lamp. A lamp that had too steep an edge would create a dim light, as the flame would not receive enough oxygen. As well it was important to either tilt the bowl or have some method of drainage for the fat, as without this the wick would essentially be drowned.

	We eventually managed to have the lamp lit for over 50 continuous minutes. During this process we also realized the difficulties associated with moving the lamp and refueling it. The lamp needed frequent attention and the addition of more fuel. If these lamps were to be carried into a cave it would be difficult to maneuver without disrupting the flame.  As well it would be necessary to carry the extra fuel into the cave.

	While this project was certainly a very simple example of an experimental archaeological approach to research, I found it forced me to think about artifacts in a different way. Experimental archaeology is important as it examines how people may have used what we find in meaningful and practical ways. In creating and attempting to use objects, it provides archaeologists with firsthand experience and evidence of the challenges and possible solutions associated with the use of artifacts. In many ways it can help identify the why of an object or building and further questions to research!
