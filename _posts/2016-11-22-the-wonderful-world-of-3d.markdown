The last week we have been discussing the implications and opportunities to use 3d modelling and photogrammetry in archaeology. Photogrammetry uses multiple photos taken from multiple angles of one stationary object to create a 3d model. I attempted to make my own using 123dCatch an app available on iPhones and tablets. The app was quite helpful in guiding you through the process. I had one excellent success (see below) and quite a few failures. My first attempt at creating a model of my model of the Vucedol dove, a neolithic pot found in Croatia, went very well. However my next subject was flint. This was unfortunately where things went down hill. Apparently shiny doesn't work quite as well...

What was great though was in the process I found some really fantastic models and creators from a website called sketchup. They all focus on sharing archaeological artifacts or sites and they do it well! The detail is extraordinary and it provides an opportunity to see things in a whole new way. 

The British Museum post scans of their artifacts and statues. If you can't afford a trip to London this is acts as an excellent substitute.

Dr. Hugo Anderson-Wymark is a UK based archaeologist who works predominately in the Orkneys and Northern Scotland. His site models are insane! They provide access and a perspective that would be nearly impossible to achieve in any other way. The neolithic Orkney sites he documents are a UNESCO world heritage site and this is an excellent way of digitally preserving them as well as making them more accessible. Also neolithic Orkney is, simply put, very very cool.

The Ancient Art archive focuses on rock art. Their scans are as beautiful as the art. 

Enjoy!
