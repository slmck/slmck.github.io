This topic has been a major interest of mine and I am very excited to share it here!  The Gravettian is a time period, dating between 28,000 and 21,000 years ago. For more information about the period check out this <a href="https://slmck.github.io/2016/10/17/a-new-series-the-gravettian.html"> infographic </a>.  It during this period that elaborate ritual burials are seen. Many of which, or if your like me, all of which are incredibly interesting. These burials included grave goods, often jewellery, beads, figurines or tools. In some cases the graves were for two or three individuals rather than just one, as we are more familiar with today in Western cultures. Sometimes the graves included mammoth bones as covers or tops to the grave. However the element were focusing on today is ochre.

 Ochre is a pigment, most commonly red though it can be yellow or brown that has been used by humans for various purposes across time and history.  During the Gravettian, ochre was applied to burials and used as a paint to create cave art. It has historically been associated with symbols and rituals within archaeology. This has been well documented in historic and cultures cultures and is commonly used for ritual purposes or body decoration,. Unfortunately though we have no way to confirm the exact nature of ochre use in the Gravettian until the invention of time machines (oh what I'd give for a TARDIS). 

ï¿¼Of the known Gravettian burials, a minimum of thirty-one of them use red ochre. To see where these sites are explore the map below!

and Konstenki, not included on the map as I'm still learning how to use a computer...</center>

It is interesting to note that in these
burials, red ochre was almost
exclusively used. The burial of Arena Candide also known as Il Principe, is the only burial known to utilize another shade. In addition to the red ochre lying underneath the skeleton, the Prince was found with yellow ochre applied to a wound in his jaw. As it was applied to a wound  it may indicate that the yellow ochre served a different purpose.

How ochre appears on the skeleton differs throughout the burials. Researchers believe that different methods of ochre application may result in these different patterns.  To identify these methods the archaeologist examines where the bones are stained. If the top and bottom of the bones are covered it means that the body was completely wrapped, likely in a shroud type covering that was covered in or possibly stained with ochre. If only the bottom of the bones are stained than the body was likely lying on a bed of ochre or an ochred blanket. Certain skeletons only have ochre applied to specific body parts like their head or pelvis, in which case the ochre was likely directly applied. Finally ochred objects or additional ochred human remains were also included on occasion. The ochre was most commonly included as a shroud or blanket burial.

I used this data to analyze whether the methods of ochre application differed according to geographic region. I completed a GIS survey to determine which methods occurred within 100kms of each other. The answer is not so much. As can be seen in the chart below, most methods of ochre application were found in every region of Europe. If there were specific regional traditions we would expect to see specific methods only found in certain locations.  This result supports the belief that the Gravettian was a pan-European culture with widespread communication.

It is importat to note that this graph is using modern day boundaries. Many of these sites are closer together than the division might make them appear. However many of the same methods are used across Europe. Unfortunately this is another occasion in which my computer skills have failed me. I hope to rectify this in the future!

As you may have noticed two small regional trends were found. The first of these is the inclusion of only ochred objects.  This practice only occurs in northern Italy, however within this region many other methods of ochre application are used. This would suggest that this practice might be a local custom in addition to the mortuary ochre procedures that occur throughout the European Gravettian.
The second local trend is the inclusion of ochre stained skeletonized human remains in addition to the main burials. This happens in a single site called Sunghir in Russia. This cannot necessarily be interpreted as regional as it does not appear at the very nearby site of Kostenki. What it does do however is raise interesting questions about the meaning of this specific location. The Sunghir site includes one single and one double burial, both of which include elaborate grave goods and date to approximately 26 and 29 thousand years ago. All of these burials are associated with additional ochred human remains. The double burial includes a femur of an adult that has been filled with red ochre  As the bone had been filled with ochre, it is evident that the remains were skeletonized when it was included in the burial.  As we all know it is impossible or at least extremely painful to shove ochre into a bone before it's a skeleton. The single burial was deliberately associated with the cranium of a female placed on an ochred region directly on top of the burial. These additional remains are interpreted as ritual deposits within the graves.
