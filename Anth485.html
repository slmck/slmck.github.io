This is the reflective component of my Anth 485 assignments

  The creation of this blog and website consisted of a lot of trial and error.  I decided to create this website on tinypress, which provided a very basic template. This was an excellent decision, as it meant I was able to alter it substantially but all of the fundamental building blocks were already formed. During my attempts to make new pages, add photos or even change the colour of the sidebar, I would often have to try four or five different things before it would work.  I realized Google was an excellent tool. I was able to use various tutorials and pre-worked code to add things such as my social media accounts and a search bar. I would like to continue to enhance my knowledge of css. Many aspects of the blog have been coded in HTML that is not as effective. I did have problems creating a css framework to center photos or edit the location of text. I plan on completing the more in-depth CodeAcademy program in the future to help with this problem. Overall though I am quite proud of the website I have created.  The website is easy to navigate and I was successfully able to separate the reflection posts and the blog posts into two separate pages. Additionally I believe the website has a very clean design and is aesthetically pleasing. This will hopefully entice readers into exploring the website further.

	I designed the content of the website to be very informal. My audience, with the exception of these posts, is not academic in nature and as such I wrote with that in mind. I tried to make the writing funny and approachable; as that was the style I found that I enjoyed most when reading other blogs.  For the topic of public archaeology I decided to explain and discuss an archaeological methodology; experimental archaeology. Public archaeology should be accessible, engaging and of interest to the public. I tried to keep a narrative within the blog to help engage the reader and make the post more exciting than a list of facts. For my first post I picked a topic where I could incorporate photos. I believe the photos create a more exciting post, as it provides a second type of media. I hope that I will be able to embed videos into posts shortly to further engage with different types of content.  I am slightly nervous that the posts were written too casually. However, I was trying to aim for a funny and personable narration style that I felt lent itself towards a casual tone. Finally I tried to make the post not only entertaining but also informative.

	Measuring success in digital archaeology is difficult. It could be measured by the quality of its content. Is the content accessible? Is it useful to others? Does it generate discussion? Alternatively it could be measured strictly be the number of visitors to a site. As digital archaeology can be interpreted in so many different ways, I feel that ultimately the true measure of success is whether it reaches the goals and audience it was for which it was designed. A digital archaeological database for academic use and a post designed for public engagement with an archaeological site will have very distinct goals and be very separate products. My goal for this project was to create an accessible website and to introduce the idea of experimental archaeology in an entertaining way.  I believe that I succeeded at that.
