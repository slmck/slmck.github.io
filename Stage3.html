<H2> A Discussion with Bo </H2>

The last part of this experience is a conversation with our chatbot, Bo. A chatbot is a computer program that is created to talk to people over the internet. In fact, the term chatbot is a combination of the words "chatter" and "robot"! We programmed our chatbot to lead a group discussion about egalitarianism. To start your discussion, just hit the small button in the bottom right hand corner of your screen.
