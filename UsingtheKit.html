<H2> How to use the Exploration of Egalitarianism Kit  </H2>

In this section you can find the materials you need to use the Exploration of Egalitarianism Kit. With this experience, we aim to provide an opportunity for young people to engage with heritage and foster a sense of historical empathy in a manner that is compelling, impactful and relevant to their lives. Over the course of this experience we hope that participants will learn about the site through historical contextualisation, partake in perspective taking (for both historical figures and for their peers today), and develop an affective connection with the past.
